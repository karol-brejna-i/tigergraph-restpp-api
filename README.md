This is an effort to document REST++ API for TigerGraph database using OpenAPI 3.x specification.

The original API documentation is located here: https://docs.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-server/current/api/intro

This folder contains:

|                     |                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| restpp.api.old.yaml | OpenAPI specification converted from [Postman collection](https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/TigerGraph-Postman) I found on the web.   |
| restpp.api.yaml     | Target version of the specification that I work on from scratch.                                                                          |

I hope to use the specication to generate Java client for REST++ API.
