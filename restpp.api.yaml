          * builtin - Endpoints presinstalled in TigerGraph (like this one)
          * dynamic - Endpoints generated when installing GSQL queries
          * static - User installed endpoints

        in the parameter query string and set its value to true.
        If no type parameters are provided, all endpoints are returned.

          If you are running a single-node server, the maximum is the number of vCPUs on that node. 
          You can run lscpu in the command line of your Linux server and look in the CPU(s) 
          column to view the number of vCPUs.
